# AiO---Browser-Installer
You have install manually all browsers...
It is just for save your time.


Means after installing this SETUP file, you get an option - "Run this program". DON'T RUN please.

Go to - C:\Program Files (x86)\PS\AiO Browsers Installer

Then install the browsers which you want.. (you have to install it manually).

Bad News for those who think that the SETUP will install all browsers.

Good News for those who want only 2 browsers or 3 only, they don't want other browsers.
